# First Blog Post: whys and motivations.

This is my first blog post on this site, what have brought me here is that I'm always studying new programming languages and paradigms and often I wanna talk about it but people get tired of hearding about that all the time. So this is a place where I'll post things that I judged interesting and I hope this blog will help someone sometime.
